# Cluster Simulation

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `clustersimulation` is to provide a set of utilities functions and a Shiny app to perform Monte Carlo simulations with a focus on inferential errors (type 1 error) and statistical power. The simulation can be performed either providing a dataset or manually setting all required parameters.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clustersimulation from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("filippogambarota/clustersimulation")
```

Once the package is installed the Shiny app (running locally) can be used using:

``` r
library(clustersimulation)
run_shiny()
```

The `R/` folder contains all the functions used in the Shiny that can be used also within standard R script to implement more complex and extensive simulations.

A demo version of the app can be accessed online at https://psicostat.shinyapps.io/clustersimulation-demo/
